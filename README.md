# Electron Remote Code Execution PoC

тЪая╕П **WARNING**: This project is an intentionally vulnerable Electron application.  
It is built to demonstrate how insecure Electron configurations (`nodeIntegration: true`, `contextIsolation: false`) can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via payload injection.

## ЁЯЪА Run It (Inside a VM Only)

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourname/electron-rce-poc.git](https://github.com/SleepTheGod/Electron-WebPreferences-Remote-Code-Execution/)
cd Electron-WebPreferences-Remote-Code-Execution
npm install
npm start
```
